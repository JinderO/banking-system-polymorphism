- 💰 **Transaction Management** - Deposits, withdrawals with validation
- 📊 **Polymorphic Operations** - Single interface for different account behaviors
- 🎯 **Interest Calculations** - Unique rates per account type
- 💳 **Fee Management** - Account-specific monthly fees
- 🔍 **Account Search** - Find accounts by number or owner
- 📋 **Portfolio Overview** - List all accounts with balances

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java 17+** - Core programming language
- **Advanced OOP** - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstract classes
- **Interface Design** - Chargeable interface for flexible fee management
- **Collections Framework** - ArrayList with polymorphic object management
- **Financial Logic** - Real-world banking calculations and validations

## 🏗️ System Architecture
📁 Banking System
├── 📄 Account.java (Abstract base class)
├── 📄 SavingsAccount.java (2% interest, no fees)
├── 📄 CheckingAccount.java (0.5% interest, monthly fees)
├── 📄 BusinessAccount.java (1% interest, higher fees)
├── 📄 Chargeable.java (Interface for fee calculations)
├── 📄 Bank.java (Account management and operations)
└── 📄 Main.java (Application demonstration)

## 🎯 Key OOP Concepts Demonstrated

### **Inheritance Hierarchy**
```java
Account (Abstract)
├── SavingsAccount (High interest, no fees)
├── CheckingAccount (Low interest, basic fees) implements Chargeable
└── BusinessAccount (Medium interest, premium fees) implements Chargeable
Polymorphism in Action
javaArrayList<Account> accounts = new ArrayList<>();
// Stores different account types uniformly
// Each type behaves differently for interest and fees
for (Account account : accounts) {
    account.calculateInterest(); // Polymorphic method call
}
Interface Segregation
javapublic interface Chargeable {
    double calculateFees();
    void applyMonthlyFee();
}
// Only implemented by accounts that have fees
🏃‍♂️ How to Run

Clone the repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/banking-system-polymorphism.git
cd banking-system-polymorphism

Compile the project
bashjavac -d bin src/dev/jov/*.java

Run the application
bashjava -cp bin dev.jov.Main


💡 Banking Business Logic
Account Types & Behaviors

Savings Account: 2% annual interest, no monthly fees
Checking Account: 0.5% annual interest, 50 Kč monthly fee
Business Account: 1% annual interest, 200 Kč monthly fee

Transaction Validation

Withdrawal amount validation against balance
Negative amount protection
Account existence verification

Fee System

Interface-based design allows easy addition of new fee types
Automatic monthly fee deduction for applicable accounts
Transparent fee calculation and reporting

🧠 What I Learned

Financial Domain Modeling - Translating banking rules into code
Abstract Class Design - When to use abstract vs concrete classes
Interface Implementation - Selective behavior addition
Polymorphic Collections - Managing diverse objects uniformly
Business Logic Separation - Clean architecture principles
Validation Patterns - Robust input and state checking

🔧 Code Highlights
Polymorphic Interest Calculation:
javapublic void applyInterestToAll() {
    for (Account account : accounts) {
        account.balance += account.calculateInterest();
        // Each account type calculates differently
    }
}
Interface-based Fee Management:
javapublic void applyFeesToChargeable() {
    for (Account account : accounts) {
        if (account instanceof Chargeable) {
            ((Chargeable) account).applyMonthlyFee();
        }
    }
}
Safe Transaction Processing:
javapublic boolean withdraw(double amount) {
    if (amount > 0 && balance >= amount) {
        balance -= amount;
        return true;
    }
    return false; // Insufficient funds or invalid amount
}
🚀 Future Enhancements

 Spring Boot Migration - REST API development
 Database Integration - Account persistence with JPA
 Transaction History - Detailed audit trail
 Multi-user Support - Customer management system
 Security Layer - Authentication and authorization
 Web Interface - Modern banking portal

📊 Technical Achievements

Zero-bug Transaction Logic - Robust validation prevents data corruption
Extensible Architecture - Easy to add new account types or fees
Memory Efficient - Optimal object management and polymorphism
Clean Code Principles - Single responsibility and clear naming
